This is a compilation of whatever projects we might work on in the future.

Web Phisher:
Web Phisher or Web Phish is an online application we are developing that is used to verify and authenticate URLs that are shared and received in emails, messages, websites, etc. 
It is a program primarily developed to curb the spread of phishing by providing its users a simple way of detecting suspicious and fraudulent links.

It does this by running it through a series of pre-determined checks and tests and scoring it based on how well it passes these tests. it then generates a trustworthiness scale which give the user a measure of how trustworthy this url is and helps them stay safe.
